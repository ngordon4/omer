Instructions: 

1) Unzip the files onto your computer. 
2) Open omer.js in a text-editor. 
3) Update the 3 variables that change each year, based on when the Hebrew year began, using the instructions in the omer.js file. 
4) Save changes in the Omer.js file.
5) Click on omer-Chart.htm to generate an Omer chart (after updating the annual variables in step 3). This file uses the CSS code in omer.css. Feel free to change the fonts and other styles to match your website or needs. 
6) Click on Omer-GenerateHTML.htm. This will generate raw html5 code. 

WordPress:
1) Wordpress strips out some crucial parts of the code. The current workaround is to install and activate a plugin called Shortcoder:
https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/shortcoder/
2) Create a post for your Counting of the Omer. 
3) In your Wordpress dashboard, click on Settings --> Shortcoder.
4) Click on "Create a new shortcode". 
5) Cut and paste the code generated by Omer-GenerateHTML.htm into your new shortcode. 
6) Give your new shortcode a name. I named my shortcode: Omer. 
7) Click "create shortcode". 
8) Cut and paste the following code into your Omer post: [sc name="Omer"]
9) Start counting!
